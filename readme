What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

This assignment was very helpful in helping me get more comfortable
programming in C as I did not have prior experience with it before
this class and also going between testing on armlab and development in
VSCode. Moreover, the challenge was helpful as I learned about
implementing pointers. Although debugging to successfully pass all
of the corner cases was challenging, it was fun finding flaws in
my logic through tracing the input material myself. The assignment
also helped clear up questions I previously had on DFAs and build
my intuition on how to best design/implement one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

No bugs! For the challenge portion of the assignment, I implemented
pointers.
