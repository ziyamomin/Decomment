What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the

"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and

should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

This assignment was very helpful in helping me get more comfortable
programming in C as I did have prior experience in it and also
going between testing on armlab and developing in VSCode. Moreover, the
challenge was helpful as I learned about implementing pointers. Although
debugging was challenging to successfully pass all of the corner cases,
it was fun finding flaws in my logic. The assignment also helped clear
up questions I previously had on DFAs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

No bugs! For the challenge portion of the assignment, I went the
pointers route.
